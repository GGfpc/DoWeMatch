# DoWeMatch

## What is it?

Do we match is a simple app that checks compatibility based on a series of question.

## How does it work?

The user can select between predefined questions or write their own. Questions have a boolean yes or no answer which the other user must answer correctly.
In the end, the app calculates the match-rate.

## Why though? ##

Great question! This was mostly made to test Android development.
